# Master Thesis
Language from the domain of space and movement is often used when talking about time. People spontaneously adopt one of two perspectives: an ego-moving perspective in which the subject is approaching a static future, or a time-moving perspective in which the future is approaching a static subject. Based on the perspective adopted, it can be said that we are approaching a deadline or that a deadline is approaching. Earlier research has suggested that reporting on uncertain events from a time-moving perspective can cause the event to be perceived as more serious, but also more tractable. The aim of this experimental research is to examine the effect of the time perspective that the participants spontaneously adopt and the time perspective of the article on the perception of the war in Ukraine. Participants (N = 801) filled out a questionnaire via an online link that measured the time perspective they spontaneously adopt, as well as their anxiety and their perception of risk, solvability of the war, inevitability of consequences, and urgency after reading an article about the war written from the time-moving or the ego-moving perspective. Results suggest that the interaction of the spontaneous time perspective and the time perspective of the article affects anxiety and the perception of urgency, while it does not affect the perception of risk, solvability of the war and inevitability of the consequences.
